Virtual Entomological Museum

With the advent of Word Wide Web from the 1990s, much of what existed only in the physical world began to exist in the virtual world as well. 
An example is the museums that, though traditionally remembered as conservation institutions for historical objects or construction of art, also hold other types of collections. 
In this work the entomological museum is approached, which consists of a collection of insects organized mainly for study purposes. 
The objective was built a virtual entomological museum in which the species can be viewed in 360 degrees. 
The motivation of the work was the fact that existing virtual museums present only two-dimensional insect photographs, which limits the visualization of the species. 
With the use of scripts that manipulate photographs, and developed a web application in which insects can be rotated 360 degrees for observation. 
The method showed up simple and low cost, being feasible for this type of application.
